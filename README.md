# FitBit.app

Got sick of using "drivebit" app to block my fitbit data while on my motorcycle, so with my jailbroken iphone,
I use the following programs

* Activator - by Ryan Petrich - http://rpetri.ch/cydia/activator/<br>
* Activate - Command by jharris - http://cydia.saurik.com/package/org.rdharris.activatecommand/
* Python-FitBit - By Orcas - https://github.com/orcasgit/python-fitbit

To help trigger when I activate/deactivate my Sena 20S to trigger code that records start and end of trip,
to send to FitBit.

Thus not skewing my daily figures for my FitBit.
